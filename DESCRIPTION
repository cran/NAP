Description: Conducts Bayesian Hypothesis tests of a point null hypothesis against a two-sided alternative
             using Non-local Alternative Prior (NAP) for one- and two-sample z- and t-tests (Johnson, V. and Rossell, R. (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00730.x>).
             Under the alternative, the NAP is assumed on the standardized effects size in one-sample tests and
             on their differences in two-sample tests. The package considers two types of NAP densities:
             (1) the normal moment prior, and (2) the composite alternative. In fixed design tests,
             the functions calculate the Bayes factors and the expected weight of evidence for varied 
             effect size and sample size. The package also provides a sequential testing framework using the
             Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design. The functions calculate the operating characteristics (OC)
             and the average sample number (ASN), and also conducts sequential tests for a sequentially 
             observed data.
